##Study Drills:

> 2) Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead.
     Can you see why you might use that instead of """?
     
     Triple single quotes does not work. If it did it wouldn't make
     sense to use it.  In writing multiple lines of text you would
     likely come across single quotes that need to be escaped so 
     double quotes would make more sense anyway.
     
     
Rubocop offenses:

offense: Line is to long.
solution: Set format string equal to a much shorter variable
