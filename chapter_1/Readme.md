#Rubocop offense solution

I got rid of the offenses by fixing the strings.  I replaced the double quotes
with single quotes and vice versa.  I did this because I probably could have
told Rubocop to ignore the double quotes offense but I believe it is more
efficient to use single quotes and if I should make the less efficient mistake
of using double quotes when unneccesary I would like Rubocop to tell me.
