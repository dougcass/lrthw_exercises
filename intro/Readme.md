> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading is essential to assimilating new information and writing is essential 
to communicating  and entering code.

Attention to detail is essential to creating code that works and is bug free.
Coding languages require precise syntax that needs to be exact to work correctly.

Spotting differences is essential to locating discrepancies in code.
Being able to locate differences in seperate blocks of code is esssential to 
fixing problems.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

We need to train our hands, brain and mind in how to read, write and see
code.
Creating muscle memory through repetitive typing is essentisl to the learning process 
and using copy and paste as a shortcut defeats the purpose of the learning process.

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice makes perfect or at least competent for now.  Practicing involves repetition
that is essential to learning new skills. 
Persistence is not giving up and fighting through frustration and obstacles 
that we will undoubtedly encounter.  We cannot give up,  we must be persistent.
